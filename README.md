# Amazon Product Reviews Analytics
It is not always easy to select the best product from a myriad of products on Amazon. Even though Amazon provides a recommender system, it can still be a hassle for customers to select the best product based on a desired attribute of products. Customers can go through product reviews to get insights on product performance during usage by previous customers but this is not also very easy to go through as the reviews can also be many. The Amazon product reviews engine we are creating can help potential customers analyze product reviews to obtain common themes on product performance. The system developed can also helped in product development and innovation.
